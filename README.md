# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the world of Tic Tac Toe.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking empty squares with their symbol, either "X" or "O". The goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
